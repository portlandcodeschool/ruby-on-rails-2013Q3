###This week you will:

0. Discuss self-assessment topics as a group to check your progress

0. Present and provide feedback in code walkthroughs. Presentation elements will include:
	* the purpose of the code
	* inputs
	* processing, with major methods and data structures
	* outputs
	* tests
	* style guide "offences" and rationale

0. Continue [Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com) at least through #100

0. Finish all of the [Ruby Foundations Deep Dive](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/programming/ruby-foundations) screencasts on Treehouse. 

0. Read and watch the topic information you will need for the code challenge (See below)

0. Do the third code challenge in pairs in class and outside of class.
(to be supplied Wednesday)

### Topics

0. The Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTP)

	HTTP tutorial 

	[Part 1](http://dev.tutsplus.com/tutorials/http-the-protocol-every-web-developer-must-know-part-1--net-31177) - up through "Using HTTP in Web Frameworks and Libraries" - we'll cover the rest in our Sinatra materials
	
	[Part 2](http://dev.tutsplus.com/tutorials/http-the-protocol-every-web-developer-must-know-part-2--net-31155) - up through "Identification and Authentication" - the rest is optional.

	[Very comprehensive HTTP Tutorial](http://dev.tutsplus.com/series/http-succinctly--net-33683) - for the intensely curious - optional

0.  REST - a lightweight but powerful way to design web APIs

	[Short HTTP and REST Tutorial](http://dev.tutsplus.com/tutorials/a-beginners-introduction-to-http-and-rest--net-16340) - some repetition and an introduction to REST, Try to ignore the PHP examples... even the author says, "PHP, although designed for the web, is probably not the best language to use when working in a REST way"

  [Longer REST Tutorial](http://www.restapitutorial.com/index.html) - there's a lot here including some tips and links to lots of resources

0. HTML Forms

	[Treehouse Forms Screencasts](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/websites/html/forms) - a basic general purpose introduction (or review for some folks) for HTML5 forms

	[W3Schools Section on Forms](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_forms.asp) - Information, examples, and reference documentation for HTML forms.

0. Sinatra

	[Introductory Screencast](http://screencasts.org/episodes/introduction-to-sinatra) - uses HAML instead of ERB, but quick

	[The Sinatra Website](http://www.sinatrarb.com) - comprehensive but short so read the whole thing at least once

	[Build Podcast on Sinatra](http://build-podcast.com/sinatra/) - Nice coverage but she moves quick, making and correcting some mistakes along the way.

	[Beginner Tutorial](http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/ruby/singing-with-sinatra/) - nice intro but goes deeper than we need.

	[Sinatra Recipes](http://recipes.sinatrarb.com) - in particular, [testing with MiniTest](http://recipes.sinatrarb.com/p/testing/minitest?#article).

0. Tools - We'll use a combination of "curl" and Chrome to tickle our web application with HTTP transfers. Both have their place. Here are introductory materials

  [Developer Tools Screencasts](http://discover-devtools.codeschool.com) - in particular, the [network tools](http://discover-devtools.codeschool.com/chapters/5)

  [Installing curl](http://curl.haxx.se/download.html) - although - it's probably already on your Mac

  [Using curl to simulate http transactions](http://curl.haxx.se/docs/httpscripting.html)
