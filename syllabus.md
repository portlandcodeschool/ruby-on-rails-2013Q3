Objectives
=================
 
Core Abilities
--------------
The core abilities for students in our program are as follows. They are designed to be the overarching goals for everything you do. Each of them have been specifically requested by the employer network and we believe that they are good goals for all developers to aspire to and flesh out.

1. Create code quickly and efficiently
1. Create high quality code
1. Collaborate with teammates effectively
1. Understand and apply current technologies
1. Learn new technologies easily
1. Understand and apply computer science concepts
1. Understand and apply business and product development concepts
1. Speak effectively about technology in interviews and while networking
1. Utilize the technical and functional aspects of each lesson’s topic


Educational Expectations
=======

Student Time Commitment
----------
Class hours: **Monday & Wednesday 6p-9p, plus one Saturday a month, 9a-4p** Saturday hours will be announced at least 2 weeks in advance.

This course requires 6 hours most weeks, 13 hours one week each month, for classroom time. In addition, students will have to devote approximately 20 outside hours of their own time each week. 

So, bottom line, this is a second job of between 25-30 hours each week if you want to get your money's worth.

For the most part, the classroom will be open and staffed with an instructor or teaching assistant during business hours. Office hours with your instructor are as given above (in classroom) or by prior arrangement (online or in classroom). 

Student Effort
--------------
This class is "homework first" - with the exception of the first session, all sessions require students to prepare by watching screencasts, reading assignments, coding, testing, or otherwise performing assignments /before/ the next class so that they arrive ready and prepared to contribute to the team. You will **not** have the opportunity to catch up in class. 

Students who attend class unprepared diminish the learning opportunities for everyone, not just themselves.

Mutual Respect
--------------
This class depends upon an atmosphere of mutual respect among students and staff. Together, we create a safe place to listen, learn, speak candidly, and fail safely. This is not a typical college class, it's a team effort producing a final product: jobs for everyone. You have the opportunity to make deep connections here that you will enjoy the rest of your career. 

Students are expected to act at their highest capacity and with mutual respect for each other regardless of age, race, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, or prior experience. Instructors are expected to lead in this regard by example.

In a related vein, this class requires work in close proximity to others as we code and debug in pairs and small groups. Good hygiene is mandatory and an additional sign of respect for your colleagues.

If you experience or perceive a problem, attempt to work it out on your own, if possible, but do not hesitate to bring it privately to the attention of your instructor. If this is unsatisfactory, bring it to the attention of Cris Kelly, Portland Code School Director.

Additional Expectations
-----------------------
Each term, students may collaboratively establish other norms and expectations specific to that cohort.

<!-- 
My sticking points
  Coming to class late (even 5 min)
  Leaving class early
  screens open during lecture (I promise to keep it short)
  Not doing the prep before a session

Teaching method
===============

This course relies on the following cycle to teach each new concept:

1. Watch, listen, read, and write
1. Play & fail
1. Challenge yourself
1. Collaborate with others
1. Teach

**Watch, listen, read, and write:** Some concepts are easy, some take a little while longer to internalize. So we provide multiple modalities: screencasts, reading, conversation. We encourage note-taking both personally, by hand, and for the class as whiteboard or easel scribe

**Play and fail:** Children learn faster than adults because they play and they don't care about failing. We encourage a playful, safe learning environment. We use interactive coding tools and encourage students to try every new idea out for themselves. We encourage test-driven development, where the first step is failure (and the last step is triumph!).

**Challenge yourself:** Studies have shown that you learn the most when you have the most to lose - right after failure. For some people, it feels bad to feel stupid. For us, confusion is the first sign that we're learning and the first taste of fun times ahead.

This course teaches students how to become self-learners, how to challenge themselves to learn new skills through experimentation and trial and error. To that end, many exercises and quizzes are taken from around the web through a meticulous process to make sure the carefully curated work is relevant and high quality. The answers are all available to students if they look for them. None of these are tests in the traditional sense. If they wanted to, students could easily find, copy, and claim these answers for their own. However, this would all but guarantee that they do not acquire the skills necessary for employment. By participating in this course, students agree not to use google, StackOverflow, or similar methods to simply find, copy, and claim  answers to exercises and quizzes for their own work.


**Collaborate with others:** Employers tell us that the most important skill is working on teams. Students work together in pairs and larger groups to understand problems, design solutions, and construct code. They use test-driven design to verify that their solutions work. They perform code walk-throughs to compare their work with the rest of the class. The point is to make sure that *everybody in the class* arrives at a working solution, not to find out which students are capable of finding a solution on their own and which are not.

This class puts an emphasis on participating in community. We require students to attend local community events in the beginning, then we expect them to volunteer at and eventually lead community events. Like experienced developers, we use the community as our primary means for building a business network and finding employment.

**Teach:** You don't fully understand something until you teach it to others. This class requires students to teach each other and gives them frequent practice in small, easy doses to help them become comfortable.

This also includes blogging and contributing to online forums like mailing lists and StackOverflow.com. Helping others in the community by relating what you know is an excellent way to earn a good reputation and build a personal brand. The reason this is such a wonderful time to be learning software development is because people are so willing to help each other. Students learn how to pay this forward.

Student projects
-----------------
After getting some basics under their collective belts, students will be requested to identify one or two potential projects that they can accomplish in teams of 2 or 3. These projects should provide meaning or value on a topic the students find interesting. If they can't identify a project, Portland Code School and its network of partners and employers may have several to choose from.

Students will pitch one of these projects to the PCS staff and will collaborate with staff to scale the scope so that students have a good chance of success by the end of term (including some failures along the way!).

During the final week of class, students will present their completed projects to their fellow students, staff, and members of our employer network.
